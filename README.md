## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Use the provided `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. **Open the Jupyter notebook**  
   Open `ECE228Project-Group47-RiNN.ipynb` and update the base directory path to your local setup.

3. **Select the dataset**  
   - To run on the SISO dataset, rename `dataset_siso.json` accordingly.
   - The default is `dataset_1RIS.json`.

4. **Update voxel path in training loop**  
   Modify the `voxels_path` parameter in the training cell:
   ```
   path_to_your_repo/channel_scatter_room/scene_voxels_1RIS.npy
   ```
   or
   ```
   scene_voxels_SISO.npy
   ```

5. **Run all notebook cells to train or evaluate the model**
